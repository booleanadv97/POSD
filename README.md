# POSD Systemüõ°Ô∏è
## Intro
Innovative web application that integrates and utilizes the Privacy Knowledge Base (PKB), a structured set of resources, rules, and guidelines related to privacy and data security.
The application aims to combine all elements of the PKB, providing comprehensive support for the design and re-engineering of privacy and security-oriented systems.

POSD leverages modern technologies to provide a robust solution.
The frontend is built using **React**, a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. 
**React** allows for efficient rendering and seamless user experiences through its component-based architecture.

On the backend, the application utilizes **Strapi.io**, a flexible and open-source headless CMS that simplifies content management and provides a highly customizable API. 
**Strapi.io** facilitates smooth communication between the frontend and the backend, ensuring that the application can easily integrate with the **Privacy Knowledge Base (PKB)**.

## How to use
- To run the **POSD System** you can start by cloning the repo.
- After that make sure both frontend and backend components are up (**yarn develop** for the **backend**, **yarn start** to start the **frontend** component).
- Once you've done that you can manage the **CMS** (backend) by accessing http://localhost:1337/ (admin credentials: g.mariniuc@studenti.uniba.it : Fafafagh97 ) or simply navigate the **POSD System** at http://localhost:3000/.
